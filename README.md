# What is Waifu2x-Extension-GUI?
`Image` & `GIF` & `Video` Super-Resolution using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

Based on `Waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan` and `Waifu2x-converter` . 

Thanks to waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan, Waifu2x-Extension could use any kind of gpu that support `Vulkan`, even Intel GPU. 

If your gpu doesn't support vulkan, you can use Waifu2x-converter, which is also intergrated into the Waifu2x-Extension.
